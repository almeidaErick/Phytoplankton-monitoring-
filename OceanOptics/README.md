Ocean Optics


OceanOptics directory contains 2 more directories "Files" and "Libraries" which contain:

Files:

* oceanOp.py -> python file that uses STS spectrometer predefined library to implement readings for reflectance and fluoresence.
* For more information on how oceanOp.py was implemented, please refer to the directory "Files".

Libraries:

* python-seabreeze -> library that contains the functions needed in order to communicate woth STS Spectrometer via serial interface.
* To find and example on how to create an instance of the STS Spectrometer object, please refer to the directory "Libraries".
* A direct link to the Git Repository for this library is (https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze).

NOTE...!!!

* The library was not modified at all, only the functions were used.
* Feel free to add more functions if needed to the file oceanOp.py.
* All the functions of oceanOp.py were tested and are working as expected, same goes to the library functions for STS Spectrometer.
